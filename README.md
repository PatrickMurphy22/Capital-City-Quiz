1. The title of the page "CAPITAL QUIZ".
2. When the user starts the quiz, the heading will be given a href via JavaScript to take the user back to the start

## Index Page 

   The Index Page is the only HTML page for this website, my goal was to us DOM manipualtion to control HTML and change the look of the page rather then having numerous HTML pages.

   Content: 
   1. Text that invites the user to select from the 3 difficulties located below
   2. 3 difficulty section ranging from Easy(Beginner), Medium(Journeyman), Hard(Seasoned)

# Technology 

### Technology used 

1. HTML
2. CSS 
2. JavaScript


## HTML 

    I used HTML for the bones of this website, at the beginning I had 4 seperate HTML with mostly repetative code. Upon learning what JavaScript was fully capable of led me to removing 3 HTML pages.
    HTML is used for 14.9% of the website. 

## CSS 

    I used CSS to add the flair and colors to the website. CSS is used throughout the website providing different colors per difficulty along with adding some linear gradient effects.
    CSS is used for 18.6% of the website.

## JavaScript

    I used JavaScript for just about everything in the website from altering the text in HTML and creating and deleting ID's and Classes to completely hiding DIV's and containers. Along with this i used JavaScript to change CSS properties if a users pick was correct or incorrect.

    Alot of what was done with JavaScript could of easily been done with HTML and CSS but to become more fluent and competent in JavaScript I believed it practical to control and maniulate the DOM with JavaScript. This also led me to being able to remove so much repetitive HTML code.

    JavaScript was used to iteriate through buttons and addEventListeners to wait and see if the user picked the correct answer and what to do and display if the user did so. Along with this and storign global variables which I could then display at a later part of the Quiz I.E displaying the users score at the end then picking what comment to display depending on the user's score.

    However there are parts of the code which I believe can reduce when I get a better grasp of JavaScript.
    

    JavaScript is used for a massive 66.5%
